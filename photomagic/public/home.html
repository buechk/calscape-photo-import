            <p>How to Review photos: <br>
                The role as a Calscape reviewer is essential in maintaining the quality and accuracy of our plant photo
                database.
                This involves ensuring that all contributed photos are of high quality, properly documented, and
                relevant to the intended species.
                Reviewers also play a pivotal role in maintaining the appropriateness of the content, confirming that
                each image's primary focus aligns
                with the specified species while minimizing any potential confusion with other plants in the photo.
                Additionally, they verify that key fields
                such as author, species, copyright, and date are correctly filled in. By upholding these standards,
                reviewers help create a reliable
                and comprehensive botanical resource, enriching the experience for all Calscape users.
                <br>Your diligent efforts as a reviewer help us provide the most reliable and comprehensive botanical
                resource possible. Thank you for your invaluable contribution to our community.
